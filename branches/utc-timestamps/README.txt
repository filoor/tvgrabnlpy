By default all timestamps that are generated by tv_grab_nl_py are in the
Amsterdam timezone.

This works fine as long as your computer is also in the same timezone, but
if you live outside the Netherlands it makes more sense to have all timestamps
in UTC, so you can caculate the difference to your local timezone yourself,
or let e.g. have mythtv do this for you 

If you use this in combination with mythtv select the "auto" timezone in the
mythtv setup.
